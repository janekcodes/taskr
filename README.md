## 📌 Motivation

As I started using different automation tools on Windows, I kept running into the same frustrations.

Most tools I tried were either:
- too heavy for simple tasks  
- overly complicated to set up or understand  
- dependent on external runtimes or scripting environments  
- or limited in how much control I actually had over the system  

At some point, I realized I wasn’t just looking for “another tool” — I was trying to find something that felt simple, fast, and fully under my control.

That’s what led me to start building Taskr.

I wanted to create a **minimal, native Windows automation engine in C++** that focuses on doing one thing properly: making repetitive tasks easier without adding unnecessary complexity.

This project started as a small experiment with WinAPI and low-level input handling, but as I worked on it, it naturally evolved into something bigger.

The goal is to build a foundation for automation that is:
- fast and lightweight  
- simple to understand and extend  
- fully native to Windows  
- and not dependent on external frameworks or runtimes  

Taskr is still early, but the long-term vision is clear:

> a clean, reliable automation engine that stays minimal at its core while growing in capability over time.

## ✨ Features (Current Phase)

### 🧱 Core System
- Native WinAPI window (no frameworks)
- Fully resizable desktop UI
- Custom rendering system (GDI)
- Responsive layout scaling
- Clean message loop architecture

### 🎨 UI System
- Centered dynamic text rendering
- Responsive font scaling
- Minimal white UI design
- Status display ("Task: In Progress")

### ⚙️ Build System
- MinGW-w64 compatible
- One-command build via `.bat`
- Optimized compilation (`-Os -s`)

---

## 🧠 Vision

Taskr aims to evolve into a full automation engine similar to:

- TinyTask (lightweight macro recorder)
- AutoHotkey (automation scripting engine)

but focused on:

- ⚡ Native performance (C++)
- 📦 Minimal binary size (~1MB target)
- 🧠 Simplicity and clarity
- 🔧 Full system-level control

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### 💻 Core Language
- C++ (17/20 standard, depending on compiler support)

### 🪟 Platform
- Windows API (WinAPI)
- GDI (Graphics Device Interface) for rendering
- User32 / Kernel32 system libraries

### ⚙️ Build System
- MinGW-w64 (GCC 15.x)
- Batch scripting (`build.bat`) for automation

### 🎨 UI & Rendering
- Native WinAPI windowing system
- GDI text rendering (CreateFont, DrawTextW)
- Manual repaint system (WM_PAINT)

### 🧠 Architecture Style
- Modular component-based architecture
- Engine-driven design (Task Engine → Input Layer → Recorder → Player)
- Event-driven message loop (WinMain / WndProc)

### 🧪 Tooling
- VS Code (development environment)
- Git + GitHub (version control)
- Windows Terminal / PowerShell (build & run)

### 🚀 Optimization Focus
- Minimal binary size (~1MB target)
- No external dependencies
- Compile-time optimization (`-Os -s`)
- Native system calls only
